# Rust Standard Library Showcase 🦀

A comprehensive demonstration of **20 essential Rust standard library features** for developers getting familiar with Rust.

## 🎯 Purpose

This repository serves as an **educational resource** for Rust developers who want to:

- Learn the most important Rust standard library features
- See practical examples of Rust's powerful abstractions
- Understand how to use Rust's core functionality
- Get hands-on experience with both basic and advanced concepts

## 🚀 Features Demonstrated

The showcase demonstrates **20 key Rust standard library features**:

### **Basic Features**
1. **Threading** - Named threads and thread management
2. **Time Operations** - Timing and duration handling
3. **Collections** - HashMap and HashSet usage
4. **File I/O** - File creation, reading, and writing
5. **Path Operations** - Filesystem path manipulation
6. **Synchronization** - Arc and Mutex for thread-safe sharing
7. **Environment** - Accessing environment variables
8. **Process Execution** - Spawning subprocesses
9. **Error Handling** - Result pattern matching
10. **Option Type** - Some/None handling

### **Intermediate Features**
11. **Network Operations** - TCP listener creation
12. **Iterators** - Functional programming with iterators
13. **Custom Formatting** - Implementing Display trait
14. **Memory Operations** - Size, alignment, and capacity management
15. **Operator Overloading** - Implementing Add trait

### **Advanced Features**
16. **Pin and PhantomPinned** - Self-referential structs
17. **Future and Async** - Manual future implementation
18. **Rc and RefCell** - Shared ownership and interior mutability
19. **Any Type** - Dynamic typing and downcasting
20. **Panic Handling** - Safe panic recovery

## 📚 How to Use

### Prerequisites
- Rust toolchain installed (`rustc`, `cargo`)
- Basic familiarity with Rust syntax

### Running the Showcase

```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/ioma8/rust-stdlib-showcase.git
cd rust-stdlib-showcase

# Build and run
cargo build
cargo run
```

### Exploring the Documentation

This repository includes **comprehensive Rust documentation** with the same look and feel as the official Rust docs:

```bash
# Build documentation locally
cd docs
cargo doc --no-deps --open
```

Or visit the **online documentation**: [https://ioma8.github.io/rust-stdlib-showcase/](https://ioma8.github.io/rust-stdlib-showcase/)

### Expected Output
The program will execute all 20 features sequentially, showing:
- Clear section headers for each feature
- Practical examples with real output
- Error handling demonstrations
- Memory and performance insights

## 🎓 Learning Path

This showcase is organized to help you learn Rust progressively:

1. **Start with basics** (features 1-10) - Core Rust functionality
2. **Move to intermediate** (features 11-15) - Common patterns and traits
3. **Master advanced** (features 16-20) - Advanced Rust concepts

## 🔧 Code Structure

```
src/
└── main.rs          # Contains all 20 feature demonstrations

README.md           # This file - documentation and usage guide
Cargo.toml          # Project configuration (no external dependencies)
```

## 💡 Key Learning Points

- **Memory Safety**: See how Rust ensures safety even with complex patterns
- **Zero-Cost Abstractions**: Learn how Rust provides high-level features without runtime overhead
- **Fearless Concurrency**: Understand Rust's approach to thread safety
- **Trait System**: Explore how traits enable polymorphism and code reuse
- **Error Handling**: Master Rust's approach to robust error management
