# Introduction

Welcome to the **Rust Standard Library Showcase**! 🦀

This comprehensive guide demonstrates **20 essential features** from Rust's standard library, designed to help developers understand and master Rust's powerful capabilities.

## 🎯 What You'll Learn

This showcase covers three levels of Rust standard library features:

### Basic Features (1-10)
Core functionality every Rust developer should know:
- Threading and concurrency
- Time operations and timing
- Collections (HashMap, HashSet)
- File I/O operations
- Path manipulation
- Thread synchronization
- Environment variables
- Process execution
- Error handling with Result
- Option type usage

### Intermediate Features (11-15)
Common patterns and advanced traits:
- Network operations (TCP)
- Iterator patterns
- Custom formatting
- Memory management
- Operator overloading

### Advanced Features (16-20)
Advanced Rust concepts for complex scenarios:
- Pin and self-referential structs
- Future trait and async foundations
- Shared ownership patterns
- Dynamic typing with Any
- Panic handling and recovery

## 🚀 Getting Started

Each feature is documented on its own page with:
- **Overview** - What the feature does
- **Code Example** - Real code from the showcase
- **Explanation** - How it works
- **Use Cases** - When to use it
- **Best Practices** - Recommended patterns

## 💡 How to Use This Guide

1. **Sequential Learning**: Start with Basic Features and progress to Advanced
2. **Reference**: Jump to specific features as needed
3. **Hands-On**: Run the actual code from the repository
4. **Practice**: Experiment with the examples

## 📦 Repository

This documentation accompanies a working Rust project. You can:

```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/ioma8/rust-stdlib-showcase.git
cd rust-stdlib-showcase

# Build and run
cargo build
cargo run
```

The program executes all 20 features with real output you can see and experiment with.
